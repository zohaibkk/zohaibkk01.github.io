<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

*Empowering the World through Technology and Service*

With a background in Electronic Engineering (BE) and nearing the completion of my Master's in Information Technology, I am deeply immersed in the realms of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and prompt engineering. My passion lies in harnessing the power of cutting-edge technology to address real-world challenges. 

I am proud to have received two distinguished awards for my impactful contributions to the QS Impact initiative, focusing on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3 and 4. These accolades stand as a testament to my commitment to creating a more inclusive and equitable world for all. 

Having worked as a Drive Test Engineer, I honed my technical expertise while ensuring seamless connectivity in critical communication networks. Additionally, my experience as a Computer Science Teacher for O-level and A-level students allowed me to inspire and guide the next generation of innovators. I also took on the role of Robotics Club Incharge, fostering creativity and problem-solving skills.

My guiding principle is to "make this world a better place for everyone". I believe that through the convergence of technology, education, and community engagement, we can drive positive change that transcends boundaries. Let's collaborate in shaping a brighter future for all.
